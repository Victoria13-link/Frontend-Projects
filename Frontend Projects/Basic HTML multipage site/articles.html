            <h2>"Why I fell in Love with Web Development</h2>
            <p>I still remember the first website I ever built. It was a simple page about 
            my favorite video games, with bright blue Comic Sans text on a purple background. 
            Looking back, it was absolutely terrible - but I was hooked.<br><br> What drew me to web 
            development wasn't just the ability to build things that people could use, but the 
            constant evolution of the field. Every few months, there's a new framework, a better 
            way to solve an old problem, or an innovative approach that changes how we think about 
            building for the web.<br><br>Three years into my professional career, that excitement 
            hasn't faded. Whether I'm optimizing load times, debugging a tricky UI issue, or learning 
            a new technology, I'm reminded why I chose this path. Web development is the perfect blend 
            of creativity and logic, art and science.<br><br>The web is where ideas become reality, and 
            I'm grateful to play a small part in shaping it - even if my designs are a bit better than 
            that first purple monstrosity. </p>
