            <div>
                <p><strong>Dr. Sarah Chen, Professor of Computer Science, UT Austin:</strong>        
                "Alex was one of my standout students in Advanced Web Development. Their ability to grasp 
                complex concepts quickly and apply them creatively in projects was impressive. Alex consistently 
                went beyond assignment requirements and helped classmates understand difficult topics."</p>

                <p><strong>Michael Torres, Senior Developer & Workshop Instructor:</strong>        
                "I mentored Alex during their internship program, and I was struck by their eagerness to learn and 
                attention to detail. They took feedback well and showed significant growth in just a few months. Any 
                team would be lucky to have Alex."</p>

                <p><strong>Prof. Linda Matthews, Database Systems Instructor:</strong>        
                "Alex demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills in my database design course. Their final project 
                was among the best I've seen in ten years of teaching - both technically sound and creatively implemented."</p>
